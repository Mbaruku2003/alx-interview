tthis is where we are going to implement the star wars api project
where we will start dealing with API in javascript how to import them , what they are and so forth
i got to learn that an API is a piece of code for which we dont know how it was created but we ave to use it in our code creation
depending on the programming language API's are always mported and are of many types
